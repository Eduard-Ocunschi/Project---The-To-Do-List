# The To Do List

Welcome to **The To Do List** project! 🎉

This simple and intuitive to-do list application helps you organize tasks in three easy stages:

1. **To Do**: Tasks that need to be done.
2. **In Progress**: Tasks you’re currently working on.
3. **Done**: Tasks that you've completed.

You can add tasks with a title, description, and timestamp, and move them between stages as you progress through them.

## Why This Project? 🤔

I built this project to dive into the world of **JavaScript**! It’s my first project, and I thought a to-do list would be a fun and practical way to start learning.💡

## Features ✨

- **Add tasks** with a title, description, and creation time.
- **Move tasks** between the different stages: To Do, In Progress, Done.
- Simple and clean design.
